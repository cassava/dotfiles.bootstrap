Bootstrap Dotfiles
==================

This repo contains a single small script to bootstrap my dotfiles with a single
command:

    curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cassava/dotfiles.bootstrap/main/bootstrap-dotfiles | bash

You can also clone the repository and run from there if you prefer.
